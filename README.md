Diminishing Returns in Team Batting Performance

This project investigates whether reducing poor individual batting performances yields diminishing marginal returns at the team level.

Player innings are scored using a contextual quality metric normalised within each match. Innings are then categorised as poor, average, or great relative to match conditions.

At the match level, the difference in poor innings between the winning team and their opponents is computed. A logistic regression model is used to estimate how this gap influences win probability.

Results suggest that while reducing poor innings significantly improves win probability initially, the marginal benefit decreases as the gap grows - consistent with diminishing returns.
